# P7 Project [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DanMeakin/P7-Project.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DanMeakin/P7-Project)

This repository contains the code from the Group 4 semester project for IDA7 at
Aalborg University.

We are designing and implementing (as far as possible within one semester) a
piece of software to provide information to bus passengers on capacity and how
busy particular buses are.
