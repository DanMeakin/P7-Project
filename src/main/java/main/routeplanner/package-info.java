/**
 * Provides route planning functionality to the system.
 *
 * The route planning functionality is somewhat limited due to the scope of
 * the project from which this system originates. The route planner is capable
 * only of finding a route between bus stops without any element of walking to,
 * from or between stops.
 *
 * Functionality is based on the algorithms described within the paper
 * Yu, Zhang, Jiafu, Tang, Shimeng, Lv, Xinggang, Luo. (2014). Floyd-Aâˆ— 
 * Algorithm Solving the Least-Time Itinerary Planning Problem in Urban 
 * Scheduled Public Transport Network. Mathematical Problems in Engineering,
